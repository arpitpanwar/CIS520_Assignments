\section{Eigenvectors}

\begin{itemize}
\item \points{7} 
Show that if $X$ has rank $p$ (all its columns are linearly independent) and $n > p$ 
then using the $p$-dimensional pseudo-inverse $X^+$ in $\hat{w} = X^+ y$ solves the least squares problem
$\hat{w} = argmin \sum_i (y - Xw)^2$.

\item \points{7} 
We want to efficiently find the largest eigenvectors of the matrix $X^TX$ where  $X$ is $n x p$ with $p \gg n$.
Show how to do this using the largest eigenvectors of $XX^T$
